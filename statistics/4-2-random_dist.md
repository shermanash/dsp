[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> here is the pmf for 1000 random numbers: ![1kpmf](https://github.com/shermanash/dsp/blob/master/img/stats4_pmf.png)

>> here is the cdf: ![1kcdf](https://github.com/shermanash/dsp/blob/master/img/stats4_cdf.png)

>> and here is a histogram of the distribution of the numbers: ![1khist](https://github.com/shermanash/dsp/blob/master/img/stats4_uniform.png)

>> it appears that the distriubtion is mostly uniform, but there are more than expected at values above 0.9 and less than expected at values under 0.1.  The distribution gets to be more and more uniform the more random numbers are chosen-- with only 10 random numbers it is hardly uniform, with 100 it gets close, and with 10000 it is very uniform.
