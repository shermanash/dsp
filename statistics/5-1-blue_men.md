[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> 49 percent of people are under 5'10", while 83% of people are under 6'1", so 34.2% of people are between these two heights.

>> in a normal distribution, 34.1% of people are 1 standard deviation above the mean.  If the distribution of heights is normal, and the mean is 177 cm, and the SD is 7.7 CM (which is almost exactly 5'10" to 6'1"), essentially the question is asking how many people are one standard deviation above the mean.  The null hypothesis would be that 34.1% of people are 1 STDev above the mean, and the alternative hypothesis would be that more or less than 34.1% of people are in this range.
