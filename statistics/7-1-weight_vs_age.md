[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> Scatter plot of birth weight vs. age: ![chap7_scatter](https://github.com/shermanash/dsp/blob/master/img/chap7_scatter.jpg)
>> percentile plot of birth weight vs age: ![chap7_percentile](https://github.com/shermanash/dsp/blob/master/img/chap7_percentiles.jpg)

>> the Pearson's correlation is about 0.07, while the Spearman's correlation is about 0.09.  The scatter plot appears to show a relationship between the two, although not a strong one.  The percentile graph appears to show a nonlinear relationship.  Birthweight increases with age at all 3 ranges, up until the mother is around 35, at which point birthweight seems to decrease significantly with age. In terms of the factors influencing birthweight, a study found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2578966/ seems to indicate that increased maternal income, education, and social status contribute to increased birth weight, up until about age 30.
